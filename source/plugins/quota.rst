Quota Plugin 
=============

Quota service, while allowing for scalability, will make sure that the cloud is
not exploited by attacks, careless use and program errors. To address this
problem, employ the quota-enforcement service that allows resource
usage within certain bounds as defined by policies and available quotas for
various entities. Quota service extends the functionality of usage server to
provide a measurement for the resources used by the accounts and domains using a
common unit referred to as cloud currency in this document. It can be configured
to ensure that your usage wonâ€™t exceed the budget allocated to accounts/domain
in cloud currency. It will let user know how much of the cloud resources he is
using. It will help the cloud admins, if they want, to ensure that a user does
not go beyond his allocated quota. Per usage cycle if an account is found to be
exceeding its quota then it is locked. Locking an account means that it will not
be able to initiate a new resource allocation request, whether it is more
storage or an additional ip. To unlock an account you need to add more credit to it.
In case you want the locking to be disabled on global or on account scope those 
provisions are also provided.
